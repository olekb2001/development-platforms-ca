# Development Platforms CA – News Platform (Supabase Frontend)

## Overview
This is my submission for the **Development Platforms course assignment (FED2-24)**.  
I chose **Option 2 – Supabase Frontend**.  

The project is a simple **news platform** where:
- Users can **register** and **log in** with email/password.
- Logged-in users can **submit articles** (title, body, category, optional image).
- Everyone (even logged-out visitors) can **browse all articles**.
- Logged-in users can **delete their own articles**.
- The app is responsive and styled with a dark/red theme.

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd development-platforms-ca
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Supabase setup
1. Create a new [Supabase project](https://supabase.com/).
2. Create a table called `articles`
3. Enable **Row Level Security (RLS)** on the `articles` table.
4. Add these policies:
   ```sql
   -- Anyone can read articles
   create policy "Public can view articles"
   on articles for select
   using (true);

   -- Only authenticated users can insert
   create policy "Authenticated users can insert their own articles"
   on articles for insert
   to authenticated
   with check (submitted_by = auth.email());

   -- Allow users to delete their own articles
   create policy "Users can delete their own articles"
   on articles for delete
   to authenticated
   using (submitted_by = auth.email());
   ```

5. Create a **storage bucket** called `article-images` (public).  
   Add a policy so **authenticated users can upload** and **public can read**.

### 4. Configure environment
In the project root, create a `.env` file:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 5. Run app
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
